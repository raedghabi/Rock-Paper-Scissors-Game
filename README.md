A simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game in Python where you play against the computer.  

---

## How It Works

1. The player is prompted to enter a choice:  
   - **Rock** (`r`)  
   - **Paper** (`p`)  
   - **Scissors** (`s`)  
   - Or **`q`** to quit the game.  
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.  
3. The program compares the choices and determines the winner:  
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Same choice results in a tie  
4. Emojis are used to represent each choice for a fun experience.  
5. After each round, you are asked if you want to continue playing.
